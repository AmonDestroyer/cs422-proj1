    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p id = "intro">
        As the impact of climate change becomes increasingly apparent, understanding and predicting
        future weather patterns has become crucial. A web app focused on climate cast can provide users
        with valuable insights into climate trends and predictions for their location. To achieve this, 
        the app will use tools from Data Science and Machine Learning, particularly time series forecasting, 
        to derive models that can forecast future weather patterns. By leveraging the power of AI and ML, this 
        web app can provide an accessible and user-friendly way for people to gain insights into the future of 
        their local climate.
