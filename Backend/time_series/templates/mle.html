                <p>Picking a problem from the <a href="problem.html">Problems</a> page and uploading it to the MLE page helps to calculate 
                    the error mean of the model. This step is crucial for model evaluation, as it identifies the 
                    accuracy of the predictions and areas that require improvement. Regular testing with different 
                    datasets allows for identifying and fixing errors, ensuring the model remains effective.

                <h1>Uploading your solution</h1>
                <p>To ensure the accuracy of your data analysis results, it's essential to check them against the 
                    original data. After developing a solution, you can test it against a separate set of data or 
                    compare the results manually with the original data. By doing so, you can identify errors and 
                    inconsistencies and refine your approach to data analysis. To check your solution, submit
                    your solution by uploading a txt, csv, JSON, exel, or xlsx file. You will be able to see how 
                    your solution compares.
